Addon for EDDiscovery

When I'm out exploring I usually have EDDiscovery open on a second monitor, so when I enter a system I can quickly check if that system is fully mapped on EDSM (all bodies in the honk bodycount is there on EDSM). If it's fully scanned I just check if there is that little dollar sign besides any body (indicating a high value body), so that I can DSS scan it. If there's no high value body, I just move along. If the system is not fully mapped on EDSM, then of course I stop and do an FSS scan.

Now this is a workable system, but I'm lazy and my eyesight is not like it used to be for example 20 years ago :-) so I'm afraid that I might miss that small dollar sign especially in a bigger system, with lots of bodies and thereby throwing potentially millions of credits out the window. So I was thinking how cool would it be if I was verbally notified when there is something interesting in the system and also of course about the fact whether the system is fully mapped already on EDSM, so I better point my FSS scanner elsewhere.

And so that's how this small addon for EDDiscovery came to be. So what does it do? When you honk a system which is fully mapped on EDSM, the addon will tell you this and also check and tell you how many high value bodies are there in the system. If the system is not fully mapped on EDSM, then the addon will alert you when you scan a high value body in FSS, so you can go and DSS it. The following are considered as high value targets: Water Worlds, Earthlike Worlds, Ammonia Worlds, Terraformable High Metal Content Bodies and Terraformable Rocky Bodies.

## How Can You Install It?
Easy. Just put it in your Users/\<Your Windows User Name\>/AppData/Local/EDDiscovery/Actions folder and it will do the magic.
